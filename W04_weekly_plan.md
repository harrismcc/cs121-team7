# Week 4 Weekly Plan

## Overview of Week
This week, we plan to work on creating the barebones functionality of our app. This includes getting our Expo enviornment up and running and creating a simple "Hello World" style app for ios and android. Furthermore, we are planning starting our spotify API integration process.

## Backlog Changes
Since this was the first week our backlog is brand new. This week our priorities are mostly Code Spikes that will help us to learn the nessisary skills and platforms that we will be using. In addition to that, deploying our (blank) app to devices also is ranked highly because it is an important starting point.

## Weekly Plan
