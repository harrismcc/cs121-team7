# Week 5 Weekly Plan

## Overview of Week
After working further towards getting a working user login and Spotify API Integration, it is time to start building core functionality of the app. This week, the goal it to get some sort of song/playlist functionality up and running.

## Backlog Changes
Last week we were mostly stuck fixing some issues from the week before, so we didn't make much progress on the tasks that were in the plan last week. Thus, we have pushed all those tasks that didn't get done to this week.

## Weekly Plan
Note: This is the same as last week's since we are pusing things back that didn't get done
