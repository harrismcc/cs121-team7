# Week 7 Weekly Plan

## Overview of Week
The goal is to get some of the song/playlist functionality up and running that we have been unable to complete in previous weeks. We will have Spotify integrated into the application, a basic UI for users to be able to play a song / pause / skip to another song.

## Backlog Changes
We are just now finishing up the Spotify API integration. Priority for this week is to create a working playlist screen where songs can be clicked and played.

## Weekly Plan
Note: This is the same as last week's since we are pusing things back that didn't get done
