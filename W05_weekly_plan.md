# Week 5 Weekly Plan

## Overview of Week
After getting some of the barebones functionality out of the way in week one, we want to move on to some more functionality. This week the goal is to get the integration with the Spotify API up and running and to flush out a UI in the app.

## Backlog Changes
Backlog is mostly the same, with only one or two items switching spots. Stories/Spikes we have completed are italisized.
